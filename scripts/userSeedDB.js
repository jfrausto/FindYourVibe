          Every timeâ€‹ that I look in the mirror
          All these lines on my face getting clearer
          The past is gone
          It went by like dusk to dawn
          Isn't that the way?
          Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, yeah

          I know nobody knows
          Where it comes and where it goes
          I know it's everybody's sin
          You got to lose to know how to win
          
          [Verse 2]
          Half my life's in books' written pages
          Lived and learned from fools and from sages
          You know it's true
          All the things come back to you
